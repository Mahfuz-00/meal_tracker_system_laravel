    | move ONLY through environment/CLI control.

    | is no per-controller code to audit.

    |                       from the Profile Manager.
    |     false           - the SSA's profile fields are read-only in the UI, and a
    |                       self-service password change is refused. Rotate the
    |                       credential with `php artisan ssa:reset-password` (or a
    |                       seeder) instead.

    |   allow_self_service_password
    |     true  (default) - the SSA may change their own password.
    |     false           - the SSA password can ONLY move via the authorised CLI
    |                       reset. Even a self-service request is refused.
