/**
 * Central dispatcher for in-app notifications.
 *
 * One place decides WHO gets told about WHAT, so the routing rules live in the
 * codebase (not scattered across controllers) and stay consistent:
 *
 *   - claim submitted      -> the member's ASSIGNED manager (+ institution admins)
 *   - claim approved/rejected -> the member who raised it (+ assigned manager)
 *   - deposit recorded     -> the member it credits (+ assigned manager)
 *   - expense claim approved  -> the member reimbursed (+ admins)
 *   - announcement         -> everyone in an institution
 *
 * All writes are best-effort: a notification failure must never break the
 * business action that triggered it.
